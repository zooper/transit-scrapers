Add these sensors to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: "Light Rail Northbound"
    resource: "http://192.168.200.56/api/northbound"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.status }}"
    json_attributes:
      - destination
      - time
      - lastUpdated
    scan_interval: 120

  - platform: rest
    name: "Light Rail Southbound"
    resource: "http://192.168.200.56/api/southbound"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.status }}"
    json_attributes:
      - destination
      - time
      - lastUpdated
    scan_interval: 120
```

## Response Format

## Troubleshooting

- **No data**: Check if the NJ Transit website is accessible
- **Browser errors**: Try restarting the service
- **Memory issues**: The service automatically manages browser instances

## Notes

- The scraper waits 8 seconds for the page to load completely
- Data is cached to avoid excessive requests
- Only one scraping operation runs at a time
- Browser is reused between requests for efficiency
